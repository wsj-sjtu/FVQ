# FVQ: A Large-Scale Dataset and an LMM-based Method for Face Video Quality Assessment (ACM MM 2025)

We explore the in-the-wild face video quality assessment problem for the first time. Concretely, we present **FVQ-20K**, the first large-scale in-the-wild face video quality assessment dataset, which contains 20,000 face videos with (a) diverse source video content, (b) various distortions in both spatial and temporal domains, (c) a variety of facial attributes, and (d) high-quality MOS annotation for each video. Along with the FVQ-20K dataset, we propose **FVQ-Rater**, the first LMM-based method elaborately designed for the face video quality assessment task as illustrated in (e).


## 📌 TODO
- [x] Release the training code of FVQ-Rater.
- [x] Release the evaluation code of FVQ-Rater.
- [x] Release the FVQ-20K dataset.


## ✨ FVQ-20K Dataset
### Download
The dataset can be downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Human-X/FVQ-20K).

### Overview
- FVQ-20K is an in-the-wild face video quality assessment (FVQA) dataset, which contains 20,000 face videos with MOS annotations.
- The FVQ-20K dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 80% : 5% : 15%.
