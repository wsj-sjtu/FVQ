We explore the in-the-wild face video quality assessment problem for the first time. Concretely, we present **FVQ-20K**, the first large-scale in-the-wild face video quality assessment dataset, which contains 20,000 face videos with (a) diverse source video content, (b) various distortions in both spatial and temporal domains, (c) a variety of facial attributes, and (d) high-quality MOS annotation for each video. Along with the FVQ-20K dataset, we propose **FVQ-Rater**, the first LMM-based method elaborately designed for the face video quality assessment task as illustrated in (e).


## TODO
- [ ] Release the training code of FVQ-Rater.
- [ ] Release the evaluation code of FVQ-Rater.
- [x] Release the FVQ-20K dataset.
